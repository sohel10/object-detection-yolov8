ðŸ”¹ What you just did

Ran BFG tool
You told BFG:

--delete-files "*.pt" â†’ delete all .pt files from history.

--delete-folders "train", "valid", "test" â†’ delete those folders from history.

âœ… That cleaned your Git history, so old large files are removed.

Ran cleanup (git gc)
You compacted the repo so it no longer stores deleted big files.

Force pushed (git push --force origin main)
That rewrote your repo history on GitHub with the smaller, cleaned version.
